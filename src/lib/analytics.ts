// Centralised PostHog wrapper for activation-funnel analytics.
//
// Mirrors sentry.ts's shape and guarantees:
//   1. Strict no-op when no API key is configured (dev/CI builds need no secrets).
//   2. Strict no-op when the user has not granted telemetry consent — this
//      module never calls PostHog.init/capture on its own; it is only ever
//      driven by ./telemetry.ts, which gates BOTH Sentry and analytics behind
//      the exact same "opencode_telemetry_consent" flag.
//   3. On consent REVOCATION, buffered-but-unsent events are DROPPED, not
//      flushed: PostHog's shutdown() normally drains the queue over the
//      network, and optOut() only blocks NEW captures (already-queued events
//      would still be sent by the next flush). So ConsentGatedPostHog
//      overrides the client's public fetch() transport; once revoked it
//      answers every SDK request with a synthetic 200 without touching the
//      network. shutdown() then "drains" the queue into that stub — clearing
//      the persisted queue and stopping timers — while zero bytes leave the
//      device.
//   4. No PII in event properties: never pass server URLs, tokens, prompts,
//      or file contents. Only coarse, enumerated event names + small typed
//      properties (booleans, enums, counts).
//
// Chosen SDK: PostHog (posthog-react-native), self-instantiated (no
// PostHogProvider / autocapture) so the app controls exactly what is sent —
// same "explicit event, no magic" posture as sentry.ts.
